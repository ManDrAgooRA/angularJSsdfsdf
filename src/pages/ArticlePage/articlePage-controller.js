Triple NRTI therapy is not considered highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Use of a triple NRTI regimen was initially developed to preserve both protease inhibitors (PIs) and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) for later use. However, study A5095 with the Adult AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG) found that in antiretroviral treatment-naive patients, treatment with Trizivir alone was inferior to 2 other efavirenz containing treatment regimens (Trizivir plus efavirenz and Combivir (lamivudine, 3TC; zidovudine, ZDV combination tablet) plus efavirenz).<sup><a class=\"j-inline-reference\" id=\"refInSitu27326\" data-refid=\"27326\" data-once-text=\"item.content\">27326</a></sup> The recommendation for use of Trizivir in HIV infection was based on analysis of surrogate markers in controlled studies of abacavir in combination with lamivudine and zidovudine.

The relationship between <em>in vitro</em> susceptibility of HIV to abacavir, lamivudine, or zidovudine and the inhibition of HIV replication in humans has not been established. Resistance to one nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor does not confer resistance to the entire class.</p><p><strong><em>•Abacavir:</em></strong> Intracellularly, abacavir is converted by cellular enzymes to the active metabolite carbovir triphosphate, an analog of deoxyguanosine-5'-triphosphate (dGTP). Carbovir triphosphate inhibits the activity of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) both by competing with the natural substrate dGTP and by its incorporation into viral DNA. The lack of a 3'-hydroxyl group in the incorporated nucleoside analog prevents the formation of the 5' to 3' phosphodiester linkage essential for DNA chain elongation, and therefore, the viral DNA growth is inhibited.</p><p>Abacavir hypersensitivity may be related to an induced autoimmunity process related to HLA-B*5701. Human Leukocyte Antigens (HLAs) help the body to distinguish “self” versus “foreign” proteins (peptides). A study determined that abacavir alters the quantity and quality of self-peptide loading into HLA-B*5701. These self-peptides are then presented for the first time and because the body has not previously recognized them, it mistakenly treats them as foreign, resulting in a polyclonal T-cell autoimmune response and multi-organ systemic toxicity. Once the drug is discontinued, reactive T-cells would be reduced and then differentiate into T memory cells. Re-exposure would again generate these peptides leading to a rapid expansion of T memory cells which could cause severe and potentially life-threatening reactions.<sup><a class=\"j-inline-reference\" id=\"refInSitu50430\" data-refid=\"50430\" data-once-text=\"item.content\">50430</a></sup></p><p><em><strong>•Lamivudine:</strong></em> The <em>in vitro</em> activity of lamivudine has been assessed in a number of cell lines where lamivudine showed anti-HIV activity in all virus-cell infections tested. Intracellular phosphorylation of lamivudine produces the 5'-triphosphate metabolite (L-TP) <em>in vitro</em>. This active metabolite inhibits reverse transcriptase and viral DNA synthesis. L-TP also inhibits cellular DNA polymerase. Combination therapy targets different points in the life cycle of HIV, reducing the ability of HIV to mutate to drug-resistant strains.</p><p><em><strong>•Zidovudine:</strong></em> Zidovudine activity is dependent upon intracellular conversion to zidovudine 5'-triphosphate (ZDV-TP); the rate of phosphorylation varies depending on cell type. ZDV-TP inhibits the activity of the HIV reverse transcriptase by both competing for utilization with the natural substrate, deoxythymidine 5'-triphosphate (dTTP), and by incorporation into viral DNA. The lack of a 3'-OH group in the incorporated nucleoside analog prevents the formation of 5' to 3' phosphodiester linkage essential for DNA chain elongation, and, therefore, viral DNA growth is terminated and production of new virions is inhibited. The active metabolite is also a weak inhibitor of cellular DNA polymerase-alpha and mitochondrial polymerase-gamma and has been reported to be incorporated into DNA cells <em>in vitro</em>.</p>"

In humans, cytochrome P450 enzymes do not significantly metabolize abacavir. The primary routes of elimination of abacavir are metabolism by alcohol dehydrogenase (to form the 5'-carboxylic acid) and glucuronyl transferase (to form the 5'glucuronide). The metabolites have no antiviral activity. Abacavir metabolites are primarily eliminated in the urine. Fecal elimination accounted for 16% of the dose. In single-dose studies, the observed elimination half-life ranges in patients with normal renal function from 0.91 to 2.17 hours.</p></li><li><p><em><strong>Lamivudine:</strong></em> Hepatic metabolism is a minor route of elimination for lamivudine. The only known metabolite of lamivudine in humans is the trans-sulfoxide metabolite, which accounts for less than 5% of a dose appearing in the urine. The mean elimination half-life with normal renal function after a single dose of lamivudine ranges 5 to 7 hours.

However, if a short-term treatment interruption is anticipated in the case of elective surgery, the pharmacokinetic properties and food requirements of specific drugs should be considered; as stopping all simultaneously in a regimen containing drugs with differing half-lives may result in functional monotherapy of the drug with the longest half-life and may increase the risk for resistant mutations. Health care providers are advised to reinitiate a complete and effective antiretroviral regimen as soon as possible after an interruption of therapy. Planned long-term treatment interruptions are not recommended due to the potential for HIV disease progression (i.e., declining CD4 counts, viral rebound, acute viral syndrome), development of minor HIV-associated manifestations or serious non-AIDS complications, development of drug resistance, increased risk of HIV transmission, and increased risk for opportunistic infections. If therapy must be discontinued, counsel patient on the potential risks and closely monitor for any clinical or laboratory abnormalities.<sup><a class=\"j-inline-reference\" id=\"refInSitu23512\" data-refid=\"23512\" data-once-text=\"item.content\">23512</a></sup><a href=\"_WPS/RefShow.aspx?rid=46638\"><sup><a class=\"j-inline-reference\" id=\"refInSitu46638\" data-refid=\"46638\" data-once-text=\"item.content\">46638</a></sup></a><a href=\"_WPS/RefShow.aspx?rid=42452\"><sup><a class=\"j-inline-reference\" id=\"refInSitu42452\" data-refid=\"42452\" data-once-text=\"item.content\">42452</a></sup></a></p><p>Abacavir has been associated with serious hypersensitivity reactions or anaphylaxis (some cases have been fatal); to reduce the risk, perform HLA-B*5701 testing on all patients before initiating treatment.

Permanently discontinue abacavir if the clinical presentation of an acute illness cannot be clearly differentiated from a hypersensitivity reaction. NEVER reinitiate an abacavir containing product in a patient who experiences a hypersensitivity reaction as more severe symptoms will recur within hours of administration and may include life-threatening hypotension and death. Severe or fatal hypersensitivity reactions may also occur within hours after abacavir reintroduction in patients who have no identified history of hypersensitivity, but who stopped abacavir for reasons unrelated to symptoms of hypersensitivity (e.g., interruption in drug supply or discontinuation while treating other medical conditions). In some cases, symptoms consistent with hypersensitivity may have been present before abacavir was discontinued, but may have been attributed to other medical conditions (e.g., acute onset respiratory diseases, gastroenteritis, or reactions to other medications). In a minority of cases, hypersensitivity reactions occurred days to weeks after abacavir reintroduction. If abacavir has been discontinued for reasons other than symptoms of hypersensitivity and if reinitiation is being considered, re-evaluate the reason for discontinuation and ensure that the patient did not have any suspected symptoms of hypersensitivity. If hypersensitivity symptoms are suspected upon review, do not reinitiate abacavir. If symptoms consistent with hypersensitivity are not identified and the patient is HLA-B*5701-negative, undertake reintroduction with caution. If HLA-B*5701 status is unknown, screening should occur prior to restarting therapy. Health care professionals should report all hypersensitivity reactions to the FDA MedWatch program (800-FDA-1088).<sup><a class=\"j-inline-reference\" id=\"refInSitu32050\" data-refid=\"32050\" data-once-text=\"item.content\">32050</a></sup></p><p>Clinical studies of abacavir, lamivudine, or zidovudine did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 years or over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients.

Other patients that may be at increased risk for bone marrow toxicity include those with folate deficiency or vitamin B12 deficiency. Cytotoxic drugs or radiation therapy may also increase the risk of myelosuppression. The HIV guidelines recommend monitoring complete blood counts (CBC) with differential at entry to care and before initiating or modifying treatment. For patients started on an antiretroviral regimen containing abacavir; lamivudine; zidovudine, a follow-up CBC with differential should be obtained after 2—8 weeks of treatment, followed by periodic monitoring every 3—6 months or as clinically indicated.<sup><a class=\"j-inline-reference\" id=\"refInSitu46638\" data-refid=\"46638\" data-once-text=\"item.content\">46638</a></sup></p><p>Abacavir; lamivudine, 3TC; zidovudine, ZDV (Trizivir) should be used with caution in patients with dental disease.

Zidovudine concentrations appear to be increased in patients with hepatic disease leading to severe hepatic impairment and increased risk of hematologic toxicity, thus requiring a reduction in the daily dose of zidovudine. Because Trizivir is a fixed dose combination of abacavir, lamivudine, and zidovudine and thus doses of one component cannot be adjusted for this patient population, the manufacturer does not recommend the use of Trizivir in patients with impaired hepatic function. Alcoholism, obesity and prolonged nucleoside exposure may also be risk factors for hepatotoxicity or lactic acidosis during nucleoside analog therapy. Fatalities have been reported with use of antiretroviral agents alone or in combination, including abacavir, lamivudine, and zidovudine. A majority of these cases occurred in females. Treatment should be discontinued in any patient who develops clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or pronounced hepatotoxicity, which may include hepatomegaly and steatosis even in the absence of marked increases in transaminases.<sup><a class=\"j-inline-reference\" id=\"refInSitu46638\" data-refid=\"46638\" data-once-text=\"item.content\">46638</a></sup></p><p>Perform HBV screening in any patient who presents with HIV-infection to assure appropriate treatment. Patients with hepatitis B and HIV coinfection should be started on a fully suppressive antiretroviral (ARV) regimen with activity against both viruses (regardless of CD4 counts and HBV DNA concentrations). HIV treatment guidelines recommend these patients receive an ARV regimen that contains a dual NRTI backbone of tenofovir alafenamide or tenofovir disoproxil fumarate with either emtricitabine or lamivudine. If tenofovir cannot be used, entecavir should be used in combination with a fully suppressive ARV regimen (note: entecavir should not be considered part of the ARV regimen). Avoid using single-drug therapy to treat HBV (i.e., lamivudine, emtricitabine, tenofovir, or entecavir as the only active agent) as this may result in HIV resistant strains. Further, HBV treatment regimens that include adefovir or telbivudine should also be avoided, as these regimens are associated with a higher incidence of toxicities and increased rates of HBV treatment failure. Most coinfected patients should continue treatment indefinitely with the goal of maximal HIV suppression and prevention of HBV relapse. It should also be noted that following discontinuation of lamivudine in patients with HBV and HIV infection, some patients experienced clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatitis B exacerbation, which has been fatal in some cases. This reaction may be more severe in patients with decompensated hepatic disease. Thus, patients with HBV and HIV should have transaminase concentrations monitored every 6 weeks for the first 3 months after stopping abacavir; lamivudine; zidovudine, and every 3 to 6 months thereafter. For patients who refuse a fully suppressive ARV regimen, but still require treatment for HBV, consider 48 weeks of peginterferon alfa; do not administer HIV-active medications in the absence of a fully suppressive ARV regimen. Instruct hepatitis and HIV coinfected patients to avoid consuming alcohol, and offer vaccinations against hepatitis A and hepatitis B as appropriate.<sup><a class=\"j-inline-reference\" id=\"refInSitu23512\" data-refid=\"23512\" data-once-text=\"item.content\">23512</a></sup> <a href=\"_WPS/RefShow.aspx?rid=32050\"><sup><a class=\"j-inline-reference\" id=\"refInSitu32050\" data-refid=\"32050\" data-once-text=\"item.content\">32050</a></sup></a>&#x20;<a href=\"_WPS/RefShow.aspx?rid=46638\"><sup><a class=\"j-inline-reference\" id=\"refInSitu46638\" data-refid=\"46638\" data-once-text=\"item.content\">46638</a></sup></a>&#x20;<a href=\"_WPS/RefShow.aspx?rid=34362\"><sup><a class=\"j-inline-reference\" id=\"refInSitu34362\" data-refid=\"34362\" data-once-text=\"item.content\">34362</a></sup></a></p><p>Antiretroviral therapy should be provided to all women during pregnancy, regardless of HIV RNA concentrations or CD4 cell count. Using highly active antiretroviral combination therapy (HAART) to maximally suppress viral replication is the most effective strategy to prevent the development of resistance and to minimize the risk of perinatal transmission. In treatment-naive women, begin HAART as soon as pregnancy is recognized or HIV is diagnosed, without waiting for the results of resistance testing; subsequent modifications to the treatment regimen should be made once the test results are available. Women who are currently receiving antiretroviral treatment when pregnancy is recognized should continue their treatment regimen if it is currently effective in suppressing viral replication; consider resistance testing if HIV RNA concentrations more than 500 copies/mL. For women not currently receiving HAART, but who have previously received treatment, obtain a complete and accurate history of all prior antiretroviral regimens used and results of prior resistance testing, and perform resistance testing if HIV RNA concentrations more than 500 copies/mL; treatment should be initiated prior to receiving resistance test results. Guidelines recommend against the use of the 3-drug regimen abacavir; lamivudine; zidovudine in pregnant women. Women who become pregnant while taking abacavir; lamivudine; zidovudine should be switched to an alternative regimen. Available data from the Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry, which includes first trimester exposures to abacavir (more than 1,360 exposures), lamivudine (more than 5,430 exposures), and zidovudine (more than 4,220 exposures), have shown no difference in the risk of overall major birth defects when compared to the 2.7% background rate among pregnant women in the US. When exposure occurred in the first trimester, prevalence of defects was 3.1% (95% CI: 2.3 to 4.2) for abacavir, 3.1% (95% CI: 2.7 to 3.6) for lamivudine, and 3.2% (95% CI: 2.7 to 3.8) for zidovudine. Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) are known to induce mitochondrial dysfunction. An association of mitochondrial dysfunction in infants and in-utero antiretroviral exposure has been suggested, but not established. While the development of severe or fatal mitochondrial disease in exposed infants appears to be extremely rare, more intensive monitoring of hematologic and electrolyte parameters during the first few weeks of life is advised. Nucleoside analogs have been associated with the development of lactic acidosis, especially during pregnancy. It is unclear if pregnancy augments the incidence of lactic acidosis/hepatic steatosis in patients receiving nucleoside analogs. However, because pregnancy itself can mimic some of the early symptoms of the lactic acid/hepatic steatosis syndrome or be associated with other significant disorders of liver metabolism, clinicians need to be alert for early diagnosis of this syndrome. Pregnant women receiving nucleoside analogs should have LFTs and serum electrolytes assessed more frequently during the last trimester of pregnancy and any new symptoms should be evaluated thoroughly. Regular laboratory monitoring is recommended to determine antiretroviral efficacy. Monitor CD4 counts at the initial visit. Women who have been on HAART for at least 2 years and have consistent viral suppression and CD4 counts consistently greater than 300 cells/mm<sup>3</sup> do not need CD4 counts monitored after the initial visit during the pregnancy. However, CD4 counts should be monitored every 3 months during pregnancy for women on HAART less than 2 years, women with CD4 count less than 300 cells/mm<sup>3</sup>, or women with inconsistent adherence or detectable viral loads. Monitor plasma HIV RNA at the initial visit, 2 to 4 weeks after initiating or changing therapy, monthly until undetectable, then at least every 3 months during pregnancy, and at 34 to 36 weeks gestation. Perform antiretroviral resistance assay (genotypic testing, and if indicated, phenotypic testing) at baseline in all women with HIV RNA concentrations greater than 500 copies/mL, unless they have already been tested for resistance. First trimester ultrasound is recommended to confirm gestational age and provide an accurate estimation of gestational age at deliver. A second trimester ultrasound can be used for both anatomical survey and determination of gestational age in those patients not seen until later in gestation. Perform standard glucose screening in women receiving antiretroviral therapy at 24 to 28 weeks gestation, although it should be noted that some experts would perform earlier screening with ongoing chronic protease inhibitor-based therapy initiated prior to pregnancy, similar to recommendations for women with high-risk factors for glucose intolerance. Liver function testing is recommended within 2 to 4 weeks after initiating or changing antiretroviral therapy, and approximately every 3 months thereafter during pregnancy (or as needed). All pregnant women should be counseled about the importance of adherence to their antiretroviral regimen to reduce the potential for development of resistance and perinatal transmission. It is strongly recommended that antiretroviral therapy, once initiated, not be discontinued. If a woman decides to discontinue therapy, a consultation with an HIV specialist is recommended.

In high-income countries (e.g., US, some European countries, Australia, Japan), approximately 10% to 17% of treatment-naive individuals have resistance mutations to at least 1 antiretroviral drug; up to 8% (but generally less than 5%) of transmitted viruses will exhibit resistance to drugs from more than 1 class. Therefore, resistance testing at baseline can help optimize treatment and, thus, virologic response. In the absence of therapy, resistant viruses may decline over time to less than the detection limit of standard resistance tests, but may still increase the risk of treatment failure when therapy is eventually initiated. Thus, if therapy is deferred, resistance testing should still be performed during acute HIV infection with the genotypic resistance test result kept in the patient's medical record until it becomes clinically useful. Additionally, because of the possibility of acquisition of another drug-resistant virus before treatment initiation, repeat resistance testing at the time therapy is initiated would be prudent. Patients with prolonged prior nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) exposure or who had HIV-1 isolates that contain multiple mutations conferring antimicrobial resistance to other NRTIs had limited response to abacavir. The potential for cross-resistance between abacavir, lamivudine, and zidovudine with other antiretroviral drugs should be considered when choosing new therapeutic regimens in previously treated patients.<sup><a class=\"j-inline-reference\" id=\"refInSitu46638\" data-refid=\"46638\" data-once-text=\"item.content\">46638</a></sup></p><p>Monitor patients for signs of myopathy and myositis, as they have been reported, along with pathological changes similar to that produced by HIV, with prolonged use of zidovudine.</p><p>Use abacavir; lamivudine, 3TC; zidovudine, ZDV (Trizivir) cautiously in patients with peripheral neuropathy.

Refer to the individual monographs for abacavir, lamivudine, or zidovudine for specific information concerning adverse events related to the individual agents.</p><p>Gastrointestinal adverse events that occurred during combination therapy with abacavir, lamivudine, and zidovudine include nausea (19%), nausea plus vomiting (10%), and diarrhea (7%). Adverse events noted in post-marketing reports with any of the three components include stomatitis, anorexia, decreased appetite, abdominal pain, dyspepsia, and oral mucosal pigmentation.<sup><a class=\"j-inline-reference\" id=\"refInSitu32050\" data-refid=\"32050\" data-once-text=\"item.content\">32050</a></sup></p><p>During clinical trials with abacavir; lamivudine; zidovudine, malaise and fatigue (12%), fever or chills (6%), and nonspecific pain (&lt; 1%) were reported. Vasculitis and weakness were noted in post-marketing reports.<sup><a class=\"j-inline-reference\" id=\"refInSitu32050\" data-refid=\"32050\" data-once-text=\"item.content\">32050</a></sup></p><p>Bone marrow suppression, resulting in anemia, neutropenia (5%), or thrombocytopenia, has been reported in some patients receiving abacavir; lamivudine; zidovudine due to the zidovudine component. Aplastic anemia, red cell aplasia, thrombocytopenia, and splenomegaly have also been reported postmarketing.<sup><a class=\"j-inline-reference\" id=\"refInSitu32050\" data-refid=\"32050\" data-once-text=\"item.content\">32050</a></sup></p><p>Myopathy and myositis, with pathological changes similar to that produced by HIV disease, have been associated with prolonged use of zidovudine, and may occur with abacavir; lamivudine; zidovudine. Musculoskeletal pain has been reported in 5% of patients during clinical trials. Arthralgia, myalgia, muscle weakness, CPK elevations, and rhabdomyolysis have been noted in post-marketing reports.<sup><a class=\"j-inline-reference\" id=\"refInSitu32050\" data-refid=\"32050\" data-once-text=\"item.content\">32050</a></sup></p><p>Hepatic and renal symptoms have been reported with the use of abacavir; lamivudine; zidovudine. Renal signs and symptoms have been reported in less than 1% of patients. Elevated hepatic enzymes (6%), hypertriglyceridemia (2%), hyperamylasemia (2%), hyperbilirubinemia (postmarketing), and mild hyperglycemia (less than 1%) have been reported. Lactic acidosis and severe hepatotoxicity (i.e., fatal cases of hepatomegaly with steatosis) have been reported with the use of nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, including abacavir, lamivudine, and zidovudine. Many of these cases have occurred in women. Abacavir; lamivudine; zidovudine should be discontinued if a patient develops clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of lactic acidosis or hepatotoxicity, including hepatomegaly and steatosis even in the absence of marked elevated transaminases. Pancreatitis has been reported during treatment.<sup><a class=\"j-inline-reference\" id=\"refInSitu32050\" data-refid=\"32050\" data-once-text=\"item.content\">32050</a></sup></p><p>Zidovudine has been associated with loss of subcutaneous fat, particularly in the face, limbs, and buttocks. The mechanism by which nucleoside analogues may cause body fat changes is not known; however, it has been suggested that nucleoside analogs may damage the mitochondria of adipocytes. The incidence and severity of these body fat changes are related to cumulative exposure. Switching to a non-zidovudine-containing regimen may only partially reverse these changes, and improvement may take months to years to achieve. Regularly assess patients for signs of lipodystrophy. If feasible, therapy should be switched to an alternative regimen.<sup><a class=\"j-inline-reference\" id=\"refInSitu32050\" data-refid=\"32050\" data-once-text=\"item.content\">32050</a></sup></p><p>Skin rash (unspecified) was reported in 5% of patients receiving abacavir; lamivudine; zidovudine. Alopecia has been reported during post-marketing surveillance. Suspected Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis have been reported in patients receiving abacavir primarily in combination with medications known to be associated with SJS and toxic epidermal necrolysis; because of the overlap of clinical signs and symptoms between hypersensitivity to abacavir and SJS and toxic epidermal necrolysis and the possibility of multiple drug sensitivities in some patients, abacavir; lamivudine; zidovudine should be discontinued and not restarted in such cases. There have also been reports of erythema multiforme with post-marketing use.<sup><a class=\"j-inline-reference\" id=\"refInSitu32050\" data-refid=\"32050\" data-once-text=\"item.content\">32050</a></sup></p><p>Nervous system or psychiatric adverse events reported with abacavir; lamivudine; zidovudine include headache (13%), depression (6%), worsening of depression, and anxiety (5%). Dizziness, paresthesias, peripheral neuropathy, seizures, insomnia, and other sleep disorders were noted in post-marketing reports.<sup><a class=\"j-inline-reference\" id=\"refInSitu32050\" data-refid=\"32050\" data-once-text=\"item.content\">32050</a></sup></p><p>Infection of the ear/nose/throat (5%) and viral respiratory infections (5%) were reported with the use of abacavir; lamivudine; zidovudine.<sup><a class=\"j-inline-reference\" id=\"refInSitu32050\" data-refid=\"32050\" data-once-text=\"item.content\">32050</a></sup></p><p>An observational trial correlated the recent use of abacavir, within previous 6 months, with an increased risk of myocardial infarction. Based on these findings, the manufacturer conducted a pooled analysis of abacavir clinical trials. Data from the analysis revealed no excess myocardial infarction risk when compared with the control groups. In light of the conflicting data, caution is advised when prescribing abacavir to patients with pre-existing coronary heart disease. Further, health care providers are encouraged to minimize a patient's modifiable risk factors (e.g., hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, and smoking) prior to prescribing abacavir; lamivudine; zidovudine. Cardiomyopathy was also noted in post-marketing reports.<sup><a class=\"j-inline-reference\" id=\"refInSitu32050\" data-refid=\"32050\" data-once-text=\"item.content\">32050</a></sup></p><p>Wheezing and abnormal breath sounds have been noted in post-marketing reports with abacavir; lamivudine; zidovudine.<sup><a class=\"j-inline-reference\" id=\"refInSitu32050\" data-refid=\"32050\" data-once-text=\"item.content\">32050</a></sup></p><p>Serious hypersensitivity reactions or anaphylaxis, including fatal reactions, have occurred in patients receiving abacavir.  In clinical trials, the incidence of hypersensitivity reactions to abacavir was 8% when HLA-B*5701 screening was not performed; the incidence was 1% when HLA-B*5701-positive patients were excluded. Signs and symptoms of hypersensitivity include fatigue, fever, chills, skin rash, gastrointestinal symptoms (abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting), and respiratory symptoms including pharyngitis, dyspnea, or cough. Respiratory symptoms occur in approximately 20% of patients with abacavir hypersensitivity reactions. Other signs and symptoms include malaise, lethargy, myalgia, arthralgia, edema, and paresthesias. Physical findings include lymphadenopathy, mucous membrane lesions (conjunctivitis and oral ulceration), and rash. The rash, if present, usually appears as a maculopapular rash or urticarial rash (urticaria) but may be variable in appearance. There have been reports of erythema multiforme. Laboratory findings include elevated liver enzymes, increased creatine phosphokinase, increased creatinine/BUN (azotemia), and lymphopenia. Deaths have been reported in patients receiving abacavir who were initially diagnosed with an acute respiratory disease (pneumonia, bronchitis, or flu-like illness) who were later recognized to have had a hypersensitivity reaction to abacavir that included respiratory symptoms. A delay in diagnosis of abacavir hypersensitivity can result in abacavir being continued or reintroduced, leading to more severe hypersensitivity reactions including, life-threatening hypotension, anaphylactoid reactions, hepatic failure, renal failure (unspecified), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), respiratory arrest, and death. Symptoms usually appear within the first 6 weeks of treatment, although these reactions may occur at any time during therapy. Hypersensitivity reactions have been reported upon reintroduction of abacavir therapy that has been discontinued for other medical reasons. In a minority of these patients, hypersensitivity occurred days or weeks after reintroduction of abacavir treatment. Symptoms worsen with continued therapy but often resolve upon discontinuation of the drug. Patients developing signs or symptoms of hypersensitivity should discontinue use of abacavir as soon as a hypersensitivity reaction is suspected. In patients presenting with symptoms of acute respiratory disease and other symptoms associated with hypersensitivity to abacavir, a hypersensitivity reaction should be suspected even if alternative respiratory diagnoses are possible. If the clinical presentation of an acute illness cannot be clearly differentiated from a hypersensitivity reaction, abacavir should be permanently discontinued. Patients should never be restarted on any abacavir containing product following a hypersensitivity reaction because more severe symptoms will recur within hours of administration and may include life-threatening hypotension and death. To facilitate reporting of hypersensitivity reactions and collection of information on each case, health care professionals should report all hypersensitivity reactions to the Abacavir Hypersensitivity Registry at Glaxo Wellcome by calling 800-270-0425 or the FDA MedWatch program at 800-FDA-1088.<sup><a class=\"j-inline-reference\" id=\"refInSitu29710\" data-refid=\"29710\" data-once-text=\"item.content\">29710</a></sup> <sup><a class=\"j-inline-reference\" id=\"refInSitu32050\" data-refid=\"32050\" data-once-text=\"item.content\">32050</a></sup></p><p>Severe acute hepatitis B exacerbation has been reported in patients coinfected with HIV and the hepatitis B virus (HBV) who have discontinued treatment with lamivudine. If use of abacavir; lamivudine; zidovudine is stopped in a coinfected patient, closely monitor hepatic function with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several months. If appropriate, treatment for hepatitis B infection may be warranted. Prior to initiating antiretroviral therapy for the treatment of HIV, it is recommended that all patients be tested for the presence of chronic HBV.<sup><a class=\"j-inline-reference\" id=\"refInSitu32050\" data-refid=\"32050\" data-once-text=\"item.content\">32050</a></sup></p><p>Zidovudine is associated with a decrease in vitamin B12 concentrations in patients with HIV and may lead to vitamin B12 deficiency.
